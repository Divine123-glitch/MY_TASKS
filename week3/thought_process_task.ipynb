    "How to Run the Project on Streamlit\n",
    "1. **Install Streamlit**:\n",
    "   - Ensure Python is installed (version 3.6+).\n",
    "   - Install Streamlit using pip:\n",
    "     ```bash\n",
    "     pip install streamlit\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "2. **Save the Code**:\n",
    "   - Save the code above as `task_manager.py`.\n",
    "3. **Run the App**:\n",
    "   - Open a terminal in the directory containing `task_manager.py`.\n",
    "   - Run the command:\n",
    "     ```bash\n",
    "     streamlit run task_manager.py\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "   - Streamlit will start a local server and open the app in your default web browser (typically at `http://localhost:8501`).\n",
    "4. **Interact with the App**:\n",
    "   - The app displays a menu with buttons for each action (Add, View, Update, Delete, View by Category, Exit).\n",
    "   - Click a button to select an action, then enter details in the provided text fields.\n",
    "   - Use the “Submit” or “Back to Menu” buttons to proceed or return to the main menu.\n",
    "\n",
    "How It Uses the Specified Concepts\n",
    "- **Lists**: Stores task categories (`st.session_state.categories`).\n",
    "- **Sets**: Tracks used task IDs (`st.session_state.used_ids`).\n",
    "- **Dictionaries**: Stores tasks (`st.session_state.tasks`) with task ID as key and tuple of (name, priority, category) as value.\n",
    "- **Strings**: Handles task names, priorities, categories, and user inputs.\n",
    "- **Tuples**: Stores task details (name, priority, category) for each task.\n",
    "- **For Loops**: Iterates over tasks for viewing all tasks or tasks by category.\n",
    "- **If Statements**: Controls program flow, validates inputs (e.g., priority, category), and handles menu actions.\n",
    "- **While Loops**: Used to generate unique task IDs.\n",
    "- **Input Statements**: Replaced with `st.text_input` for web-based input collection.\n",
    "- **Escape Sequences**: Replaced with Streamlit’s Markdown and HTML/CSS (e.g., `<h1 style='color: blue;'>`) for formatting, as escape sequences like `\\033[1m` don’t work in web interfaces.\n",
    "- **Variables**: Used for temporary storage (e.g., `task_id`, `task_name`, `current_action`).\n",
    "\n",
    "Thought Process\n",
    "1. **Adapting to Streamlit**:\n",
    "   - Streamlit’s event-driven model requires handling user interactions via widgets, so I replaced `input()` with `st.text_input` and `print()` with `st.write` or `st.markdown`.\n",
    "   - Since Streamlit reruns the script on each interaction, I used `st.session_state` (a dictionary) to persist tasks, used IDs, and categories across reruns, aligning with the allowed dictionary concept.\n",
    "2. **Menu Implementation**:\n",
    "   - The console-based menu (using `input()`) was replaced with buttons for each action, stored in `st.session_state.current_action` to track the user’s current task.\n",
    "   - Each action (e.g., add, view) is handled in a separate `if` block, avoiding the need for functions (`def`).\n",
    "3. **Formatting**:\n",
    "   - Escape sequences were replaced with Streamlit’s Markdown and inline HTML/CSS for visual styling (e.g., blue titles, green success messages), maintaining the intent of formatted output.\n",
    "4. **Input Validation**:\n",
    "   - Used `if` statements to validate priorities and categories, mirroring the console version’s logic.\n",
    "   - Added empty input checks for task names to ensure valid submissions.\n",
    "5. **Avoiding `def`**:\n",
    "   - Since `def` wasn’t allowed, I kept all logic inline within the main script, using `if`/`elif` to handle different actions based on `st.session_state.current_action`.\n",
    "6. **Streamlit-Specific Challenges**:\n",
    "   - Streamlit’s single-threaded nature and script rerun behavior required careful state management with `st.session_state`.\n",
    "   - I avoided advanced Streamlit features (e.g., caching, fragments) to stay within the specified concepts.\n",
    "\n",
    " Limitations\n",
    "- **No Persistent Storage**: Tasks are stored in memory (`st.session_state`) and reset when the Streamlit server stops. To persist data, you’d need file storage or a database, which requires concepts beyond the constraints (e.g., file I/O).\n",
    "- **No Escape Sequences**: Web interfaces don’t support terminal escape sequences, so HTML/CSS styling was used instead.\n",
    "- **No `while` for User Input**: Streamlit’s event-driven model eliminates the need for `while` loops for user input, but I retained a `while` loop for generating unique task IDs.\n",
    "- **Exit Action**: The “Exit” action displays a goodbye message but can’t stop the Streamlit server (this requires `sys.exit()`, which is outside the allowed concepts).\n",
    "\n",
    "Sources\n",
    "- The adaptation was informed by Streamlit’s documentation on running apps and managing state:\n",
    "  - Running a Streamlit app: `streamlit run task_manager.py` starts the app and opens it in a browser.[](https://docs.streamlit.io/develop/concepts/architecture/run-your-app)\n",
    "  - Session state: Used to persist data across reruns, as Streamlit reruns the script on each interaction.[](https://discuss.streamlit.io/t/how-to-run-a-background-task-in-streamlit-and-notify-the-ui-when-it-finishes/95033)\n",
    "\n",
    "If you want to extend the project (e.g., add persistent storage or use `def` for modularity), let me know, and I can provide guidance within or beyond the constraints!"
